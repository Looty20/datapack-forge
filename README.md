## 💬 Feedback & Suggestions

Feel free to [open an issue](../../issues)!  
Whether it's a bug report, a feature request (like new datapacks), or ideas for UI/UX improvements — all feedback is welcome. I'm still learning GitHub, so this might not be the most refined setup, but it works for now!

## ⚠️ Minecraft Version Compatibility

Minecraft updates often, and I might not always be able to keep the datapacks fully up to date.  
If you run into any compatibility issues, please don’t hesitate to report them!
