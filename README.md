Feel free to open an issue!
I'm still new to GitHub, so this might not be the perfect setup â€” but for now, please use issues to report bugs, suggest features (like new datapacks), or share ideas for UI/UX improvements. I'm always open to feedback!

Note:
Minecraft updates frequently, so I might not always be able to keep the datapacks 100% up to date. If you notice any compatibility issues, please let me know!
