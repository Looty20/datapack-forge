## ℹ️ About us

I often play Minecraft with friends, experimenting with different challenges and trying to optimize things. Along the way, we sometimes realize there are little details missing in the game — things we’d love to see implemented.

While I’m not a fan of the hassle that comes with downloading and installing mods (and explaining it to everyone else), datapacks offer a nice middle ground. They allow server-side changes without requiring each player to do anything. If a tweak is subtle enough, players won’t even notice it — and I love that part >:).

That said, I don’t always play with all the packs enabled (some feel ridiculously overpowered to me). Still, I’ve included some classics — like the craftable Enchanted Golden Apple. I've also added customization options where it makes sense (like the number of items crafted in new recipes).

Feel free to use the tool and let me know if anything’s missing!

## 💬 Feedback & Suggestions

Feel free to [open an issue](../../issues)!  
Whether it's a bug report, a feature request (like new datapacks / missing settings), or ideas for UI/UX improvements — all feedback is welcome. I'm still learning GitHub, so this might not be the most refined setup, but it works for now!

## ⚠️ Minecraft Version Compatibility

Minecraft updates often, and I might not always be able to keep the datapacks fully up to date.  
If you run into any compatibility issues, please don’t hesitate to report them!

Please do keep in mind the goal of this project: to make commonly used datapacks more accessible to people who aren't interested in learning how to make them. Because of that, adding advanced customization (like a text formatter) isn't a current priority.
